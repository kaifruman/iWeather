    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our weather app! Our app was made using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow us to gather accurate and up-to-date weather information from reliable sources. <br>

        In terms of the programming languages used to build this app, we primarily used JavaScript (JS) for the dynamic and interactive features, as well as HTML and CSS for the design and layout of the app. <br>
        
        We aim to provide our users with a user-friendly and informative weather app that helps them stay informed about the current weather conditions and forecasts for their location. <br> Thank you for using our app, and we hope you find it helpful!</p>
